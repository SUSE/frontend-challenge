Frontend Challenge
====================

The idea of this challenge is to create a UI for listing computer systems.

Here you can find a [short list of systems](https://github.com/SUSE/frontend-challenge/blob/master/systems-short-list.json) with some details per each. The goal of this challenge is to create an overview page for the list of systems with some relevant values, and a separate view for the [single system details](https://github.com/SUSE/frontend-challenge/blob/master/system-details.json).

You can choose your own path among the following levels:
+ [Entry Level](#entry-level)
+ [Intermediate Level](#intermediate-level)
+ [Advanced Level](#advanced-level)
+ [Bonus](#bonus)
